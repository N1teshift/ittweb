refactor: major service layer refactoring and type system improvements

This commit includes extensive refactoring, type fixes, infrastructure improvements,
and data pipeline enhancements that significantly improve code organization and type safety.

## Service Layer Refactoring

- Split large service files into modular, focused modules:
  - playerService: Split into update, read, compare, and utils modules
  - scheduledGameService: Split into create, read, update, delete, participation, and utils modules
  - postService: Extracted helper functions to separate module
  - entryService: Extracted helper functions to separate module
- Improved code organization with better separation of concerns
- Enhanced maintainability by reducing file sizes (files now under 200 lines)

## Type System Fixes

- Fixed 690 TypeScript errors across the codebase
- Updated AbilityData type definition to include all missing properties:
  - Added areaOfEffect, maxTargets, targetsAllowed, hotkey, castTime
  - Added availableToClasses, spellbook, visualEffects
  - Added levels object with level-specific data
- Added missing AbilityCategory types: 'auradummy', 'bonushandler', 'buff'
- Fixed playerService.update.ts DocumentData type issue
- Fixed scheduledGameService type issues (teamSize, customTeamSize, gameType, timestamps)
- Fixed api/health.ts status type definition
- Fixed userDataService.server.ts to return Timestamps instead of strings

## Infrastructure Improvements

- Enhanced API route handlers with better error handling
- Updated Header component with improved navigation and mobile menu
- Added new UI components (DropdownMenu, MobileMenu, EmptyState)
- Improved validation helpers for API routes
- Added server-side user data service utilities
- Enhanced monitoring infrastructure

## Data Pipeline Enhancements

- Improved data extraction scripts (extract-from-w3x.mjs)
- Enhanced metadata extraction (extract-metadata.mjs)
- Updated file writer utilities for better code generation
- Improved unit converter for data processing
- Enhanced ability data structure across all categories

## Testing & Documentation

- Added comprehensive test coverage for API routes
- Enhanced Firebase client tests
- Improved logging tests with better coverage
- Updated security tests (CSRF and session handling)
- Added jest-dom type definitions
- Updated documentation for Firestore indexes, security, and product status
- Enhanced API documentation for players endpoint

## Additional Changes

- Updated game service with improved utility functions
- Enhanced game list component with better filtering
- Improved archive form component
- Updated meta page with better data handling
- Enhanced player comparison and standings components
- Improved unit and ability guide data structures
- Added new shared components (GameFilters, PlayerFilter, TeamFormatFilter)

This refactoring improves code maintainability, type safety, and sets a solid foundation
for future development. All TypeScript errors have been resolved and the codebase is
now ready for production builds.

# Systems Documentation

Deep dives for the main subsystems that power ITTWeb. Start here when you need architectural context or when onboarding a co-developer.

- `game-stats/implementation-plan.md` – design + milestones for the statistics experience (services, APIs, UI breakdown).
- `scripts/` – icon pipeline, extraction guides, and historical notes (with `overview.md` as the index).
- `replay-parser/` – integration plan and quick start for processing replays.

Each subfolder owns its own structure; keep write-ups current and move anything outdated into the relevant `archive/` subfolder so AI agents don’t surface stale info.

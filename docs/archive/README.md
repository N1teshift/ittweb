# Documentation Archive

Material in this folder is preserved for historical context only. Nothing here should be treated as the current source of truth, but it can be useful when you want to reference past research or show how decisions evolved.

- `phase-0-complete.md` – snapshot of the earliest milestone.
- `twgb-pages-comparison.md` / `twgb-website-analysis.md` – old research on reference sites.

When a document becomes obsolete (or risks confusing AI agents), move it here and add a single sentence at the top explaining why it was archived.

# Cursor Rules

## Documentation Standards

### 📁 Documentation Organization

When creating or updating documentation, agents MUST follow this organized structure:

#### Documentation Structure
- **`docs/production/`** - 🚀 What stays when the project is finished
  - Custom business logic, domain-specific functionality, user-facing features
  - API documentation, data models, security implementations, system architectures
  - Examples: API specs, database schemas, feature requirements, security docs

- **`docs/development/`** - 🛠️ Internal development docs (safe to delete later)
  - Learning journey, development processes, testing strategies, operational knowledge
  - Setup guides, code patterns, deployment procedures, performance optimization
  - Examples: Development guides, testing docs, CI/CD setup, debugging guides

- **`docs/shared/`** - 📚 Reference materials and standards
  - Style guides, error handling patterns, general best practices
  - Documentation about documentation, coding standards
  - Examples: Error handling guides, documentation style, known issues

#### Placement Guidelines
1. **New API docs or business logic** → `docs/production/api/` or `docs/production/systems/`
2. **Development processes, testing, deployment** → `docs/development/operations/` or `docs/development/getting-started/`
3. **Performance optimization, caching, monitoring** → `docs/development/performance/`
4. **Code patterns, architecture decisions** → `docs/development/`
5. **Historical research, resolved issues** → `docs/development/archive/`
6. **Reference guides, standards** → `docs/shared/`

#### Important Notes
- When the project reaches production, only `docs/production/` and `docs/shared/` will remain
- The entire `docs/development/` folder can be safely deleted at that point
- Always update relevant README files when adding new documentation
- Maintain consistent file naming and organization within each section

### 📅 Date Handling in Documentation

When writing or updating documentation files (`.md` files), agents MUST:

#### Date Inclusion Requirements
- **ALWAYS** include a date when creating new documentation files
- **ALWAYS** update the date when making significant updates to existing files
- **NEVER** use estimated or assumed dates

#### Date Format Standards
- **Primary format**: `YYYY-MM-DD` (ISO 8601) for machine readability
- **Alternative format**: `Month DD, YYYY` for human readability in user-facing docs
- **Header format**: `> Date: YYYY-MM-DD` or `**Date**: YYYY-MM-DD`

#### Date Verification Process
1. **Check current date** using system command:
   - Unix/Mac: `date +"%Y-%m-%d"`
   - Windows PowerShell: `Get-Date -Format "yyyy-MM-dd"`
2. **Use actual system date** - never estimate or assume
3. **Update on significant changes** - not trivial edits

#### Examples
```markdown
> Date: 2025-12-02
**Date**: December 2, 2025
```

This ensures all documentation has accurate timestamps and reflects when content was actually written or significantly updated.

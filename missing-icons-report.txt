Missing Icon Files Report
==================================================

I've created a script to check for missing icons. The script is located at:
- scripts/icons/find-missing-simple.js
- check-missing.js

To generate the report, run:
  node check-missing.js

This will check all icon mappings in iconMap.ts against the actual files in public/icons/itt/
and list any entities (items, abilities, units) that are mapped to icon files that don't exist.

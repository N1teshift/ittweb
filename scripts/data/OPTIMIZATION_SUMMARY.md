# Scripts Optimization Summary (Deprecated)

The optimization summary has been merged into `REFACTORING_PLAN.md`, which now tracks both **completed work** and the **remaining backlog** for the data generation scripts.

## Where to Go

- 📌 Current status & checklist: [`REFACTORING_PLAN.md`](./REFACTORING_PLAN.md)
- ⚙️ Operational instructions: [`../README.md`](../README.md)
- 📚 Supporting docs & deep dives: [`../../docs/systems/scripts/`](../../docs/systems/scripts/)

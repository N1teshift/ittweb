## Extracted Artifacts

This folder contains raw outputs from the extraction phase. They are regenerated by the Python scripts under `../scripts/current/`. Do not edit them by hand.

| File | Producer | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `abilities.json` | `extract_abilities_from_wurst.py` | Normalized ability metadata (id, name, category, mana/cooldown). |
| `ability_descriptions.json` | `extract_ability_descriptions.py` | Tooltip text keyed by ability id. |
| `buildings.json` | `extract_buildings.py` | Building stats, descriptions, craftable items. |
| `item_stats.json` | `extract_item_stats.py` | Bonus stats scraped from crafting definitions. |
| `recipes.json` | `extract_recipes.py` | Full recipe list plus item/unit registries. |
| `units.json` | `extract_units.py` | Base/sub/super class data (hp, mana, growth, stats). |
| `missing_items.json` | (legacy) | Historical diagnostics list of missing icon/data entries. |
| `subclass_superclass_data.ts` | legacy scripts | Hardcoded relationships used by generators. |

### Notes
- Downstream generators under `../scripts/current/` read these files and write TypeScript outputs to `src/features/ittweb/guides/data/`.
- If you add a new JSON artifact, document it here along with the script that produces it.
- When troubleshooting pipeline runs, always inspect this directory first to confirm the extraction phase produced fresh data.
